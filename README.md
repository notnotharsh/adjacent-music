# Adjacent Music
This project was primarily motivated out of a desire to have a service that could
* analyze which genres a user listened to
* break down genres adjacent to those genres to expand the user's music taste (e.g. someone into jazz and funk could be recommended Afrobeat music)
* recommend tracks in those adjacent genres that still had similar audio features as the tracks that made up the user's listening history (e.g. high danceability, low valence, etc.).
</ul>
It is still in development, but will hopefully be exapanded in the future to be able to have more precise recommendations. As it stands, the project uses a user's top 50 artists to create a list of genres to recommend (in Spotify, genres are associated with artists), and a user's top 50 tracks to create a range of audio features. These genres and audio features are then used with the /recommendations endpoint of Spotify's API to generate the recommendations created in every playlist.
